# Loan Calculator

### Vanilla Javascript Projects

#### Project description

##### Our goal is to create a loan calculator that accurately calculates the monthly payments for a given loan amount, interest rate, and payment term. The calculator will consist of three input fields: loan amount, interest rate, and payment term. By entering these values, users will be able to determine the monthly payment required to fully repay the loan within the specified time frame. Any changes made to the input values will automatically update the monthly payment amount. To implement this, we will utilize HTML to create the input fields, CSS to enhance the visual appearance of the project, and JavaScript to perform the necessary calculations based on the provided input.
